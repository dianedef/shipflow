# sf-auth-debug

> Diagnose a broken authentication flow in a real browser with Playwright, then pinpoint the exact failure step instead of guessing from code alone.

## What It Does

`sf-auth-debug` is ShipFlow's browser-auth diagnosis skill. It consumes the existing bug report or spec, reproduces the auth flow with Playwright when possible, and isolates where the flow breaks across UI triggers, Clerk/OAuth configuration, redirects, middleware, cookies, sessions, and post-login app behavior.

It is designed for cases where static code reading is not enough because the failure only becomes clear once the real browser flow runs.

## Who It's For

- Founders debugging login issues on their own apps
- Developers working on Clerk, OAuth, Google login, or protected app flows
- Teams that need reproducible browser-level evidence before fixing auth bugs

## When To Use It

- when login, callback, or session behavior is broken in the browser
- when a Clerk or OAuth bug needs real-flow reproduction
- when redirects, cookies, or middleware behavior look wrong
- when a spec or bug report exists but the exact browser failure point is still unclear
- after an auth fix to confirm the original break is actually gone

## What You Give It

- a bug description, spec, or failing auth flow
- ideally the environment, URL, provider, expected behavior, and observed behavior
- optionally existing repro steps or known error messages

## What You Get Back

- the exact failure point in the auth flow
- browser-level evidence: URLs, page state, visible errors, and useful network/console signals
- a primary diagnosis category tied to code or configuration
- the next recommended fix or verification step

## Typical Examples

```bash
/sf-auth-debug login with Google returns to sign-in page
/sf-auth-debug Clerk callback fails on staging after Google auth
/sf-auth-debug users authenticate but land on a blank dashboard
```

## Limits

- It does not guarantee a fully automated Google login flow.
- MFA, captcha, device approval, WebAuthn, and similar human-gated steps may block full automation.
- It is a diagnostic skill, not a replacement for `sf-fix`, `sf-start`, or `sf-verify`.

## Related Skills

- `sf-fix` for quick bug triage and direct fixes
- `sf-spec` when the auth bug still lacks a clear contract
- `sf-start` to implement the chosen fix path
- `sf-verify` to confirm the repaired auth flow is ready to ship
- `sf-prod` if the issue only appears after deployment

# ShipFlow V3: Spec-Driven Workflow

## Summary

ShipFlow V3 shifts iteration upstream.

The current documentation frame is already solid on three axes:

- technical: `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md`, `CONTENT_MAP.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, and `specs/`
- workflow: `sf-spec`, `sf-ready`, `sf-start`, `sf-verify`, `sf-docs`, and versioned metadata
- product/business: `BUSINESS.md`, `BRANDING.md`, versioned docs, and `depends_on` relationships

The recent progress is structural rather than cosmetic:

- a clear agent entrypoint
- a dedicated context layer
- a metadata and lint doctrine
- a cleaner separation between active docs, trackers, and runtime content

Default operating stance:
- complete the context before execution
- make the contract implementable by a fresh agent
- avoid “prompt and correct” loops as the normal path
- treat late clarification as a bounded exception, not the workflow itself

Bug intake entrypoint:

```text
sf-fix -> fix directly or route to spec-first path
```

Optional model-selection entrypoint before execution:

```text
sf-model -> choose model / reasoning / fallbacks before sf-start
```

For non-trivial work, the default flow is:

```text
sf-explore -> sf-spec -> sf-ready -> sf-start -> sf-verify -> sf-end
```

For small, explicit, local fixes, the fast path remains:

```text
sf-start -> sf-verify -> sf-end
```

The goal is not to remove iteration. The goal is to move ambiguity reduction before coding, then let verification close the loop when implementation or spec drift appears without turning the workflow into iterative prompt repair.

## Core Principles

- `sf-explore` is for ambiguity reduction, not implementation.
- `sf-spec` produces an implementation contract, not loose notes.
- `sf-ready` enforces a real Definition of Ready before non-trivial execution.
- `sf-start` begins execution from a ready contract instead of rediscovering intent, and now decides both model routing and execution topology before coding.
- `sf-verify` checks against the spec first, then quality and risks, and can now remediate limited gaps.
- `sf-end` closes the task against the delivered scope, not only against the diff.
- agent handoffs should be one-pass: complete context up front, no hidden dependency on chat history, explicit linked systems and consequences.
- business, brand, and documentation artifacts are decision contracts, not passive notes.
- every reusable ShipFlow artifact should be traceable through metadata, evidence, status, risk, and next step.

## Specs As Chantier Registry

`specs/` is the global registry for spec-first chantiers. A chantier spec is not only an implementation contract; it also keeps the durable run history for the skills that acted on that chantier.

Each chantier spec should expose:

- `source_model` in frontmatter when `sf-spec` creates or materially updates the spec
- `Skill Run History` with `Date UTC`, `Skill`, `Model`, `Action`, `Result`, and `Next step`
- `Current Chantier Flow` for the readable status of `sf-spec`, `sf-ready`, `sf-start`, `sf-verify`, `sf-end`, and `sf-ship`

Skill application categories:

- `obligatoire`: `sf-spec`, `sf-ready`, `sf-start`, `sf-verify`, `sf-end`, and `sf-ship` trace their current run when exactly one chantier spec is in scope.
- `conditionnel`: audits, docs, checks, fixes, deps, perf, migrations, scaffold, content, research, test, prod, backlog, priorities, tasks, changelog, review, and veille skills trace only when the run is explicitly attached to one unique chantier spec.
- `non-applicable`: help, context, model selection, exploration, status, resume, and session naming do not write to specs; if invoked inside a chantier flow, they report `Chantier: non applicable` or `Chantier: non trace` when useful.

That trace category is separate from the internal process role:

- `lifecycle`: creates, readies, starts, verifies, ends, or ships an existing chantier.
- `source-de-chantier`: audits, diagnostics, checks, tests, prod verification, migrations, fixes, research, market study, or veille can reveal work that deserves a new spec.
- `support-de-chantier`: docs, content, scaffolding, changelog, design playground, skill refresh, or init work supports a chantier but should not normally originate one.
- `pilotage`: backlog, tasks, priorities, review, and continuation manage the flow and route to spec when the user or evidence requires it.
- `helper`: context, model choice, help, status, resume, exploration, and naming stay read-only for chantier writes.

The upstream intake flow is:

```text
source skill -> Chantier potentiel -> sf-spec -> sf-ready -> sf-start -> sf-verify -> sf-end/sf-ship
```

When a source skill finds non-trivial future work without one unique chantier, it must not write into a guessed spec. It should add a `Chantier potentiel` block with `oui`, `non`, or `incertain`, proposed title, reason, severity, scope, evidence, and a recommended `/sf-spec ...` command. `sf-spec` then consumes that block and turns it into the durable chantier contract.

No skill should create a separate chantier registry in `TASKS.md`, `AUDIT_LOG.md`, `PROJECTS.md`, or `shipflow_data`. If a spec cannot be identified or multiple specs match, the skill must stop or report non-trace instead of guessing.

## Artifact Doctrine

ShipFlow separates application content from ShipFlow work artifacts.

Application content is content parsed or rendered by the project runtime: `src/content/**`, MDX blog posts, framework content collections, public SEO pages, and app-specific documentation schemas. Those files must keep the schema required by the application.

ShipFlow work artifacts are produced to run and govern the work. They include:

- agent entrypoint docs
- project context docs
- business, product, brand, GTM, architecture, and technical guideline docs
- specs
- readiness reports
- verification reports
- audit reports
- review reports
- research reports
- architecture notes
- decision records
- API/component docs generated by ShipFlow
- project business and brand documentation

ShipFlow artifacts use a standard YAML frontmatter schema. This makes them searchable, auditable, and safe to pass between skills.

That artifact doctrine also sharpens the boundary between three categories:

- active decision docs that govern implementation and audits
- trackers and registries that stay lightweight and operational
- runtime content that must preserve the application schema

Operational tracking files are not ShipFlow decision artifacts and do not require metadata frontmatter:

- `TASKS.md` tracks active work and backlog items.
- `AUDIT_LOG.md` tracks audit history.
- `PROJECTS.md` tracks project registry and domain applicability.

Do not migrate those files just to satisfy the artifact schema. If they contain durable decisions, extract those decisions into separate versioned artifacts and leave the tracker readable.

Location rule:

- `shipflow_data` is the control plane for cross-project tracking (`TASKS.md`, `AUDIT_LOG.md`, `PROJECTS.md`).
- The master tracker is not a direct substitute for a local project `TASKS.md`.
- Always distinguish between:
  - the master tracker
  - a project section inside the master tracker
  - the local `TASKS.md` file in a repo
- If a local `TASKS.md` is created after work already exists in the master tracker, split old entries into:
  - active backlog
  - historical completed context
- Do not copy completed historical entries from the master tracker into the local active backlog.
- Per-project decision artifacts belong in the project repository that they govern.
- `BUSINESS.md`, `BRANDING.md`, `CONTENT_MAP.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, specs, research, and decision records should be edited and versioned in the repo they affect, not duplicated into `shipflow_data`.
- If `shipflow_data` needs visibility, add a reference or inventory entry, not a second canonical copy.

Skill-aligned artifact templates live in `templates/artifacts/`. They should encode the structures expected by the active skills (`sf-spec`, `sf-ready`, `sf-verify`, `sf-review`, `sf-research`) instead of replacing those conventions. The current templates cover:

- `context`
- `spec`
- `business_context`
- `brand_context`
- `product_context`
- `architecture_context`
- `gtm_context`
- `technical_guidelines`
- `audit_report`
- `verification_report`
- `readiness_report`
- `review_report`
- `research_report`
- `decision_record`
- `content_map`

Validate metadata with:

```bash
SHIPFLOW_ROOT="${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-/home/claude/shipflow}"
"$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py"
```

The linter is intentionally dependency-free. It checks the default ShipFlow artifact locations (`specs/`, `docs/`, `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md`, `CONTENT_MAP.md`, `BUSINESS.md`, `BRANDING.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GTM.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`) and can also receive explicit files or folders.

When a skill runs from a project repository, ShipFlow-owned docs, tools, references, templates, and skill-local `references/*` still resolve from `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-/home/claude/shipflow}`. Only project artifacts and source files resolve from the current project root.

This decision-contract layer is wired into the active ShipFlow workflow: agent routing (`AGENT.md`), project orientation (`CONTEXT.md`), documentation doctrine (`README.md`, this file, `shipflow-metadata-migration-guide.md`), the `sf-docs` skill, and `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`.

For existing projects with legacy docs, follow [`shipflow-metadata-migration-guide.md`](./shipflow-metadata-migration-guide.md) and prefer additive frontmatter migration before deeper document rewrites.

For legacy migration, the official default scope is active context docs when they exist, active decision contracts when they exist (`BUSINESS.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `BRANDING.md`, `GTM.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTENT_MAP.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`), and `specs/*.md`. Do not expand the migration endlessly to every old markdown file unless that file is part of the active ShipFlow documentation set.

## Agent Context Layer

ShipFlow now separates agent context into three levels:

ShipFlow documentation is not meant to be encyclopedic. It is meant to be complete for fast agent navigation:

- point of entry
- operational context
- function tree for large scripts
- routing toward business, product, GTM, architecture, and guidelines
- recognition by `sf-docs` and by the metadata linter

- `CLAUDE.md`: repo constraints, critical rules, and coding guidance
- `AGENT.md`: routing doc that tells a fresh agent where to look first
- `CONTEXT.md`: compact operational map of the project

Specialized context docs can extend this layer when a repo contains a large procedural or architectural hotspot. `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md` is the reference example: it exists because a fresh agent cannot efficiently infer the structure of a large shell file like `lib.sh` from memory alone.

`CONTENT_MAP.md` extends the context layer for content-heavy projects. It maps blog surfaces, docs, landing pages, FAQs, semantic clusters, pillar pages, and cross-surface update rules so content skills can route output without rediscovering the repository structure in every thread.

This layer exists to reduce repeated discovery work in fresh threads. It is not a substitute for reading code. If a context doc and the code disagree, the code wins and the context doc should be updated.

## Decision Contract Layer

ShipFlow also separates decision contracts by role to avoid turning one document into a catch-all:

- `BUSINESS.md` defines audience, business model assumptions, value proposition, and market frame.
- `PRODUCT.md` defines product scope, workflows, outcomes, and non-goals.
- `BRANDING.md` defines voice, trust posture, vocabulary, and claims boundaries.
- `GTM.md` defines public promise, acquisition channels, proof points, objections, and funnel assumptions.
- `CONTENT_MAP.md` defines content surfaces, semantic clusters, pillar pages, and repurposing destinations.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` defines system organization, flows, boundaries, and structural invariants.
- `GUIDELINES.md` defines engineering and documentation rules for contributors.

These contracts should reference each other through `depends_on` instead of being merged into one broad strategy file.

In practice, this clarifies the product surface:

- `BUSINESS.md` = for whom / what value / what model
- `PRODUCT.md` = what / workflows / non-goals
- `BRANDING.md` = how we speak
- `GTM.md` = how we present and distribute it
- `CONTENT_MAP.md` = where content lives / how ideas move across surfaces
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` = how it is organized
- `GUIDELINES.md` = how we work inside it

Documentation role map:

- `README.md` -> public overview and repo onboarding
- `AGENT.md` -> fast agent routing
- `CONTEXT.md` -> operational map of the system
- `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md` -> structural index for large procedural files
- `CONTENT_MAP.md` -> editorial map for blog, docs, landing pages, semantic clusters, and repurposing destinations
- `CLAUDE.md` -> critical repository constraints and rules
- `shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md` -> ShipFlow work doctrine
- `shipflow-metadata-migration-guide.md` -> frontmatter migration procedure
- `BUSINESS.md` -> business/product contract: for whom, what problem, what value, what model
- `BRANDING.md` -> brand contract: tone, posture, vocabulary, claims
- `GTM.md` -> public promise and sales contract: offer, funnel, objections, proof, channels, KPIs
- `CONTENT_MAP.md` -> content architecture contract: surfaces, page roles, cocons sémantiques, pillar pages, and update rules
- `GUIDELINES.md` -> technical constraints and conventions
- `PRODUCT.md` -> operational product contract
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` -> system view and structuring invariants
- `specs/` -> local execution of a change

Each document has an explicit and exclusive role to avoid duplication, stale context, and conflicting contracts.

Minimum metadata:

```yaml
---
artifact: spec
metadata_schema_version: "1.0"
artifact_version: "0.1.0"
project: "[project name]"
created: "2026-04-25"
updated: "2026-04-25"
status: draft
source_skill: sf-spec
scope: feature
owner: "[user/team]"
confidence: medium
risk_level: medium
security_impact: unknown
docs_impact: yes
linked_systems: []
depends_on: []
supersedes: []
evidence: []
next_step: "/sf-ready [title]"
---
```

Artifact-specific metadata can extend this:

- specs add `user_story`
- business docs add `target_audience`, `value_proposition`, `business_model`, `market`
- audits add `domains`, `issue_counts`, `confidence`
- reviews add `period`, `verified_outcomes`, `assumptions`
- research reports add `source_count`, `primary_sources`, `recommendation`

Two versions serve different purposes:

- `metadata_schema_version` tracks the ShipFlow metadata contract. Increment it only when the metadata shape or required fields change.
- `artifact_version` tracks the document's decision content. Increment it when the contract changes meaningfully.

Recommended `artifact_version` convention:

- `0.x.y` for drafts or inferred/migrated artifacts
- `1.0.0` for the first reviewed/active version
- patch bump for clarifications that do not change decisions
- minor bump for changed assumptions, audience, scope, API behavior, pricing, or docs impact
- major bump for a new product promise, business model, security posture, architecture direction, or incompatible decision contract

Concrete examples:

- `1.0.0 -> 1.0.1`: typo fixes, clearer wording, added source link, same decision.
- `1.0.0 -> 1.1.0`: target audience refined, pricing assumption changed, API example updated, onboarding promise clarified, new docs impact.
- `1.1.0 -> 2.0.0`: business model changes from content to SaaS, ICP changes from consumers to B2B teams, security posture changes from local-only to multi-tenant public app, architecture direction changes incompatibly.

Status and version work together:

- `status: draft` can use `0.x.y`.
- `status: reviewed` or `active` should use `>= 1.0.0`.
- `status: stale` means the artifact may still be historically useful but should not be used as an unreviewed dependency for new implementation.
- `status: superseded` should set `superseded_by`.

Specs should record the artifact versions they depend on:

```yaml
depends_on:
  - artifact: BUSINESS.md
    artifact_version: "1.2.0"
    required_status: reviewed
  - artifact: BRANDING.md
    artifact_version: "1.0.0"
    required_status: reviewed
  - artifact: docs/API.md
    artifact_version: "0.4.0"
    required_status: draft
```

If a dependent artifact becomes stale, the spec is not automatically invalid, but it must be re-evaluated before implementation or closure.

The metadata must not pretend certainty. If an artifact is inferred from old files or weak context, use `confidence: low`, `status: draft`, `risk_level: medium|high`, or explicit `unknown` values.

## Business Docs as Decision Contracts

ShipFlow treats business documentation as technical documentation because agents use it to make technical choices.

`BUSINESS.md`, `BRANDING.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, personas, market studies, pricing notes, positioning docs, and GTM docs influence:

- what user story a feature should serve
- what copy and UX should promise
- what risks should block shipping
- what price and trust level the product must justify
- what docs, onboarding, and support surfaces must stay coherent
- what audits should consider acceptable or misleading

This means business docs need the same discipline as technical specs:

- metadata frontmatter
- explicit status and confidence
- evidence and assumptions
- review dates
- linked artifacts
- risk level
- owner
- next step

Business documentation should never be treated as generic context if it drives implementation or audit decisions.

Example:

```yaml
---
artifact: business_context
metadata_schema_version: "1.0"
artifact_version: "1.0.0"
project: "[project name]"
created: "2026-04-25"
updated: "2026-04-25"
status: reviewed
source_skill: sf-docs
scope: business
owner: "[user/team]"
confidence: medium
risk_level: medium
business_model: saas
target_audience: "solo founders shipping paid public products"
value_proposition: "Ship safer product iterations through spec-driven AI workflows"
market: "FR/EN indie SaaS and agentic development"
security_impact: yes
docs_impact: yes
evidence:
  - "user interview notes"
  - "current product positioning"
linked_artifacts:
  - "BRANDING.md"
  - "shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md"
depends_on: []
supersedes: []
next_review: "2026-05-25"
next_step: "/sf-docs audit"
---
```

## Documentation Coherence

Feature work is not complete if the user-facing behavior changed but the documentation still describes the old behavior.

When a feature changes, skills should consider these surfaces:

- README
- docs
- API docs
- component docs
- examples
- FAQ
- onboarding
- pricing
- changelog
- support copy
- screenshots
- public marketing pages

Documentation drift is a product risk when it affects:

- setup
- auth
- permissions
- payments
- security
- privacy
- API usage
- migrations
- destructive actions
- support expectations

This is why specs include `docs_impact`, why `sf-start` checks documentation coherence during implementation, and why `sf-verify` can flag stale docs as a blocking issue.

## Adoption and Migration

Older ShipFlow artifacts may not have the standard frontmatter. During adoption, `sf-docs audit` and `sf-docs update` should migrate them.

Migration rules:

- preserve the body
- add the ShipFlow metadata frontmatter
- infer only what is obvious from file name, title, date, and content
- use `unknown` for unproven fields
- use `confidence: low` when metadata is reconstructed
- do not convert application runtime content to the ShipFlow schema
- do not overwrite app-specific frontmatter needed by a framework

This lets existing work become traceable without pretending it was originally produced under the new standard.

## Professional Bug Management

ShipFlow uses a three-layer bug record so tests, triage, and evidence stay readable across sessions:

- `TEST_LOG.md` is the compact campaign log.
- `BUGS.md` is the compact bug index.
- `bugs/BUG-ID.md` is the detailed dossier for one bug.
- `test-evidence/BUG-ID/` stores redacted supporting evidence when material is too large or too sensitive for inline markdown.

The standard bug loop is:

```text
sf-test -> bug dossier -> sf-fix -> sf-test --retest -> sf-verify -> sf-ship
```

Each stage has a narrow job:

- `sf-test` captures the failure, opens or updates the dossier, and links to the compact index.
- `sf-fix` reads the dossier and appends diagnosis and fix attempts.
- `sf-test --retest BUG-ID` appends the retest history and updates the bug state.
- `sf-verify` checks whether the remaining bug state still blocks release.
- `sf-ship` consumes the final bug state when deciding whether the ship is clean, partial-risk, or blocked.

Canonical bug states stay explicit:

- `open`
- `needs-info`
- `needs-repro`
- `in-diagnosis`
- `fix-attempted`
- `fixed-pending-verify`
- `closed`
- `closed-without-retest`
- `duplicate`
- `wontfix`

Closure rules are conservative:

- `closed` requires a passing retest.
- `closed-without-retest` requires a visible reason and residual risk note.
- `needs-info` and `needs-repro` mean the bug is still unresolved, not done.
- `duplicate` and `wontfix` must point to a concrete canonical bug or decision.

Evidence rules are strict:

- keep `TEST_LOG.md` and `BUGS.md` compact
- keep large logs, HAR, screenshots, dumps, and traces out of the index files
- redact secrets, cookies, tokens, private emails, request headers, and production PII before persisting evidence
- store larger redacted material under `test-evidence/BUG-ID/`
- never paste raw sensitive evidence inline when a path reference is enough

## Workflow by Stage

### 0. `sf-fix` (bug intake)

Use `sf-fix` when your intent is "fix a bug" rather than "start a session."

It performs a short triage and routes the bug:
- local and clear -> direct fix now
- ambiguous or non-trivial -> spec-first path

Typical routed outcomes:
- direct: `sf-fix -> sf-verify -> sf-end`
- spec-first: `sf-spec -> sf-ready -> sf-start -> sf-verify -> sf-end`

When `sf-test` finds a failure first, the bug should already exist as a compact index entry plus dossier. `sf-fix` should read that dossier instead of rebuilding context from chat history.

When the bug is auth or browser-flow related, run `sf-auth-debug` before coding from theory. It consumes the bug report or spec, reproduces with Playwright where possible, and isolates failures across Clerk, OAuth, Google login, YouTube OAuth, Convex auth propagation, cookies, callbacks, protected routes, and Flutter web auth bridges. Its output should route back into `sf-fix`, `sf-start`, or `sf-verify` with evidence rather than guesses.

### 1. `sf-explore`

Use `sf-explore` when the problem is still fuzzy:
- feature idea not fully shaped
- risky refactor
- bug with unclear root cause
- cross-cutting behavior change

Expected outcome:
- clearer problem framing
- surfaced constraints
- identified unknowns
- decision to either stop, keep exploring, or move to `sf-spec`

### 2. `sf-spec`

Use `sf-spec` to create the implementation contract for non-trivial work.

The spec is expected to be autonomous and structured. It must include:
- `Title`
- `Status`
- `Problem`
- `Solution`
- `Scope In`
- `Scope Out`
- `Constraints`
- `Dependencies`
- `Invariants`
- `Links & Consequences`
- `Edge Cases`
- `Implementation Tasks`
- `Acceptance Criteria`
- `Test Strategy`
- `Risks`
- `Execution Notes`
- `Open Questions`

Status lifecycle:
- `draft`
- `reviewed`
- `ready`
- `implemented`
- `closed`

Rules:
- no `TBD`
- no blocking open questions
- every implementation task must name a file and an action
- every implementation task should also name its validation and dependency ordering
- linked systems, consumers, and downstream consequences must be explicit
- no hidden dependency on conversation history
- tasks must be ordered by dependency

`sf-spec` is the canonical entry point for initial framing. It should be the default for medium+ work.

### 3. `sf-ready`

Use `sf-ready` as the guardrail before first implementation on non-trivial work.

It verifies that the spec is actually executable:
- structure is complete
- ambiguity is low enough
- task ordering is coherent
- linked systems and side effects are explicit
- acceptance criteria are testable
- execution notes are sufficient for a fresh agent
- open questions are resolved

If the spec passes, `sf-ready` promotes it to `Status: ready`.

`sf-ready` is also the right place to decide whether execution should continue on fresh context:
- if the environment can spawn a clean fresh subagent, it may do so
- otherwise it should explicitly ask the user to open a new thread before `/sf-start`

If not, it returns a concrete `not ready` verdict and pushes the work back toward spec refinement.

### 4. `sf-start`

`sf-start` is the execution kickoff, not a discovery phase.

Behavior:
- accepts direct execution for small, explicit, local fixes
- requires a `ready` spec for non-trivial work
- blocks if the spec is missing, incomplete, or contradictory
- derives an execution contract (target files, invariants, linked systems, validations, stop conditions) before coding
- reads the shared `sf-model` routing reference before coding
- chooses a primary execution model and reasoning effort before implementation
- may assign per-group model overrides when the execution is materially non-trivial
- chooses `single-agent` or `multi-agent` execution before launching work
- loads only the execution-relevant files and the linked systems that must be revalidated
- prefers fresh context for spec-first execution when that reduces residual ambiguity

The key rule:
- if the work is ambiguous or multi-file, `sf-start` should not invent the missing intent

Topology rule:
- use `single-agent` when changes are tightly coupled or converge on the same core files
- use `multi-agent` only when write ownership is explicit and the integration cost is justified

### 5. Implementation (inside `sf-start`)

Once `sf-start` begins execution, the implementation should follow the spec contract:
- same scope
- same ordering assumptions
- same acceptance criteria
- same constraints and invariants
- same linked systems and consequence checks

If the implementation reveals a small missing delta, the loop does not automatically restart from scratch.
If it reveals a new side effect outside the contract, that is a reroute signal, not an invitation to improvise.

### 6. `sf-verify`

`sf-verify` is now both a verifier and a controlled remediation orchestrator.

It verifies in this order:
1. spec compliance
2. traceability from spec to code/tests
3. linked systems and downstream consequences
4. code quality, dependencies, and risks
5. workflow next step

It classifies the primary cause into one of these buckets:
- `specified but not implemented`
- `spec incomplete or ambiguous`
- `implemented but not specified`
- `technical failure only`
- `missing contract`
- `complete and ready`

Then it decides what to do.

#### When `sf-verify` remediates directly

If the spec is sound and the gap is only implementation:
- it can complete the missing work
- rerun the relevant checks
- mark traceability entries as `fixed during verify`

If the delta becomes too large, it should stop and route back to `sf-start`.

#### When `sf-verify` updates the spec

If the implementation exposed a small framing hole:
- it can apply a bounded mini-spec correction
- translate the answers into a mini spec delta
- update the existing spec first
- then resume implementation and re-verify

This is not a replacement for `sf-spec`.
It is a local repair path for late-discovered, bounded ambiguity.
It should not become the normal way work gets clarified.

#### When `sf-verify` reroutes

Typical routing outcomes:
- `specified but not implemented` -> remediate now, or `/sf-start` if the delta is too large
- `spec incomplete or ambiguous` -> mini-spec correction, then continue; if global drift, return to `/sf-spec`
- `implemented but not specified` -> clarify whether to keep or remove the extra behavior, then update spec or code
- `technical failure only` -> fix technical breakage and rerun verify
- `complete and ready` -> `/sf-end`

Every `sf-verify` report should end with:
- `Primary cause`
- `Action taken`
- `Next step`
- `Reason`

### 7. `sf-end`

`sf-end` closes the task against the spec and the delivered behavior.

It should:
- mark completed tasks as done
- keep partial work explicit
- record drift from the spec when it happened
- move the spec to `implemented` or `closed`
- prepare the next priorities cleanly

## Decision Rules

Use this rule of thumb:

- bug intake -> `sf-fix`
- unclear problem -> `sf-explore`
- non-trivial scoped work -> `sf-spec`
- spec candidate before first implementation -> `sf-ready`
- ready execution kickoff -> `sf-start`
- verify and possibly close the loop -> `sf-verify`
- wrap up delivered work -> `sf-end`

## Prompted Decisions

Several skills now prompt explicit choices when the next action is ambiguous:

- `sf-fix`: direct fix vs spec-first vs diagnostic only
- `sf-start`: execute direct vs spec-first vs clarify first (`sf-explore`)
- `sf-spec`: light spec vs full spec vs auto-by-risk
- `sf-context`: proceed now vs add one key file vs refine target
- `sf-verify`: fix now vs return to spec vs stop and resume later
- `sf-end`: full close vs partial close vs summary only
- `sf-status`: issues-only vs dirty-only vs all-project view

This keeps momentum while avoiding silent assumptions in decision-heavy moments.

`sf-model` is optional but useful when you want to choose manually before execution.
`sf-start` should still reuse the same routing matrix internally, so manual and automatic choices stay aligned.

## One-Pass Agent Handoff

When a skill launches agents, the prompt should already contain:
- the exact scope and absolute date
- the relevant context files already surfaced by the parent skill
- the linked systems / consumers / downstream consequences to think about
- a no-follow-up rule: missing context becomes an explicit assumption, not a clarification round
- a structured output that includes confidence and missing context

The success criterion is strict:
- a fresh agent should be able to execute or audit from the prompt alone
- if that is not true, the parent skill is still underspecified
- if a fresh context is needed for the next step and the environment cannot create it directly, the skill should explicitly ask the user to open a new thread

In practice, this matters most for:
- `sf-ready` -> deciding whether the next step should restart cleanly
- `sf-start` -> executing non-trivial work from a clean contract instead of accumulated chat state

Shortcut rules:

- if the issue is already specified and simply unfinished, do not rewrite the whole spec
- if the issue reveals real contract ambiguity, update the spec before more code
- if the missing delta is local and obvious, `sf-verify` may absorb it
- if the missing delta changes architecture or scope, go back to `sf-spec`

## Example Flows

### Small local bug fix

```text
sf-fix -> sf-verify -> sf-end
```

### New feature with ambiguity

```text
sf-explore -> sf-spec -> sf-ready -> sf-start -> sf-verify -> sf-end
```

### Feature mostly implemented but incomplete

```text
sf-spec -> sf-ready -> sf-start -> sf-verify
                                           |
                                           v
                          remediate missing specified work
                                           |
                                           v
                                        sf-end
```

### Feature reveals missing edge case late

```text
sf-spec -> sf-ready -> sf-start -> sf-verify
                                           |
                                           v
                         exceptional mini-spec delta + remediation
                                           |
                                           v
                                        sf-end
```

## What Changed from Earlier Flow

Earlier, the workflow tended to rediscover intent during `sf-start` or after failed implementation.

ShipFlow V3 changes that:
- `sf-start` is no longer the place where the problem gets clarified
- `sf-spec` is stricter and contract-oriented
- `sf-ready` is a real gate, not a nice-to-have
- `sf-verify` no longer stops at diagnosis; it can classify, clarify, remediate, and reroute
- the default target is one-pass execution from a complete contract, not prompt-and-correct after the fact
- the system now has an explicit path for incomplete implementation without automatically restarting the full cycle

## Practical Guidance

If a feature is reported as incomplete:
- use `sf-start` again only when the spec is still valid and the missing work is already specified
- use `sf-spec` again when the contract itself is insufficient
- let `sf-verify` absorb the delta when the missing work is local and safe to repair in-place

If you need several clarification rounds after implementation already started, assume the contract was too weak and route back upstream.

The important distinction is not "is the feature incomplete?"

The real distinction is:
- incomplete implementation
- incomplete contract
- implementation/spec drift

That distinction now drives the workflow.

## Questions

### Si je veux ameliorer ou elargir une feature existante, quelle skill utiliser ?

Use this decision rule:

- `sf-explore` if the change is still fuzzy (intent, scope, or expected behavior not clear)
- `sf-start` if the work is clear and already executable
- `sf-fix` if your entrypoint is "adjust/correct this existing feature" and you want automatic routing

Practical shortcut:

- if you hesitate between `sf-explore` and `sf-start`, begin with `sf-fix`
- `sf-fix` handles quick direct execution for local changes and routes to spec-first when the scope is non-trivial

### J'ai un bug: est-ce que je dois lancer `sf-verify` en premier ?

No. Start with `sf-fix`.

- `sf-fix` = intake + triage + direct execution when local/clear
- `sf-verify` = post-implementation validation and remediation loop

Recommended bug flow:

```text
sf-fix -> sf-verify -> sf-end
```

If the bug is non-trivial, `sf-fix` routes to:

```text
sf-spec -> sf-ready -> sf-start -> sf-verify -> sf-end
```

### Quand faire une revue adversariale de la spec ?

Apply this rule:

- if at least one signal is true, run an adversarial review

Signals:
- more than one file is impacted
- more than one domain is impacted (for example UI + API, backend + data)
- non-trivial business behavior
- security/data/auth/perf/migration/API contract impact
- likely edge cases
- vague wording in spec without testable criteria

Light review is acceptable only for local, obvious, single-file fixes.

### Faut-il renommer `TASKS` en `BACKLOG` ?

No. Keep both with distinct roles.

- `TASKS.md` = active, prioritized, executable now
- `BACKLOG.md` = deferred ideas and parking lot

Promotion rule:
- move an item from backlog to tasks only when it is clear enough and prioritized for execution now

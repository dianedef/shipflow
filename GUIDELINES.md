# Technical Guidelines

## Scope Of This Document

This file defines stable engineering and documentation rules for working inside ShipFlow. It is not the place for product positioning, system topology walkthroughs, or public messaging.

## Stack

- Bash-first orchestration for CLI and operational flows.
- Flox for runtime isolation.
- PM2 for managed process execution.
- Caddy plus DuckDNS for public exposure.
- Markdown artifacts plus skills for workflow governance.

## Critical Rules

- Invalidate PM2 cache after PM2 state changes.
- Validate project paths before using them.
- Prefer idempotent operations over check-then-act races.
- Do not treat generated runtime config as primary source of truth.
- Keep documentation contracts versioned when they guide implementation or audits.

## Preferred Patterns

- Use focused context docs instead of overloading one mega-doc.
- Use specs and verification for non-trivial work.
- Keep doc roles exclusive: route, context, business, product, GTM, architecture, brand, guidelines.
- Prefer explicit stop conditions over silent assumption repair.

## Anti-Patterns

- Silent success or silent failure in user-facing flows unless explicitly justified.
- Business or product claims without evidence.
- Metadata migration that rewrites content body unnecessarily.
- Using trackers as if they were decision contracts.

## Validation Expectations

- Technical checks are necessary but not sufficient.
- User-facing success and error behavior should be observable or explicitly justified.
- Docs that affect product understanding must be checked when behavior changes.

## Change Routing

- Runtime orchestration changes belong first in `lib.sh`, `config.sh`, `shipflow.sh`, or `local/`.
- Workflow and artifact-governance changes belong first in `skills/`, templates, and workflow docs.
- Product, business, GTM, and brand decisions belong in their dedicated contracts before they are repeated elsewhere.

## Documentation Expectations

- `AGENT.md` routes to the right context.
- `CONTEXT.md` maps the repo operationally.
- Specialized context docs stay narrow.
- Business, product, GTM, brand, architecture, and guidelines docs should each keep an exclusive role.

summary: "A documentation skill for generating, updating, auditing, and harmonizing project docs and supporting contracts."

audience:
  - "Founders who want cleaner documentation without bloated prose"
  - "Teams that need docs to stay operational, not decorative"
problem: "Docs decay quickly when product changes are not reflected in the files that explain how the system works."
outcome: "You get documentation that is closer to the current reality of the repo and easier to rely on during execution, including bug workflow docs that stay coherent with the tracker model."
founder_angle: "This skill matters because stale docs create the same drag as stale code: wrong assumptions, weak handoffs, and repeated rediscovery."
when_to_use:
  - "When the repo needs a new README, guide, or audit of existing docs"
  - "When implementation changed user-facing behavior or contracts"
  - "When the documentation surface feels inconsistent or stale"
what_you_give:
  - "A target file, doc mode, or documentation goal"
  - "The current repo and decision-doc context"
what_you_get:
  - "Generated or updated documentation"
  - "A stronger documentation contract for future work"

  - "It can improve documentation quality, but only the code proves real behavior"

## Documentation Coherence Checks

`sf-docs` should look for bug-workflow drift as part of a normal docs audit. That means checking whether `TEST_LOG.md`, `BUGS.md`, dossier templates, and public skill pages still describe the same operating model.

If one page still implies the old tracker behavior, the docs result should call out the mismatch instead of silently accepting it.

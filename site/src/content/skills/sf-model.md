title: "sf-model"
slug: "sf-model"
tagline: "Choose the right model for the task instead of overpaying or underpowering the work."
summary: "A model-selection skill for matching task type, cost, latency, reliability, and subagent routing needs before execution starts."
category: "Plan & Decide"
audience:
  - "Founders balancing quality, speed, and cost in agent work"
  - "Operators who want a more deliberate model choice"
problem: "Using the wrong model wastes either money, time, or execution reliability, especially across a mixed workload."
outcome: "You get a more intentional fit between the job to be done and the model doing it."
founder_angle: "This skill matters when model choice is no longer trivial. It keeps the workflow economical without pretending all tasks need the same level of reasoning."
when_to_use:
  - "When the task could reasonably fit several model tiers"
  - "When cost or latency matters materially"
  - "When a complex task may justify stronger reasoning"
what_you_give:
  - "A task description and its constraints"
  - "Any cost, speed, or reliability preference"
what_you_get:
  - "A model recommendation"
  - "A clearer tradeoff between speed and depth"
  - "A default subagent model policy: small work on GPT-5.4-mini, long implementation on GPT-5.3-Codex, high-risk reasoning on GPT-5.5"
  - "A clear note on whether the model choice is applied, a subagent override, or only a next-run recommendation"
  - "A better execution setup before work begins"
example_prompts:
  - "/sf-model for migration planning"
  - "/sf-model fast docs cleanup"
  - "/sf-model which model for this audit"
limits:
  - "It helps choose a model; it does not improve the task framing by itself"
  - "It cannot guarantee that the already-running main conversation can switch its own active model mid-thread"
  - "The best model still depends on the quality of the downstream workflow"

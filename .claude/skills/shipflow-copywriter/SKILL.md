- Product data: !`ls -la seo/products*.json 2>/dev/null | tail -5 || echo "no product files"`
- Existing copy: !`find . -maxdepth 3 -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.mdx" -o -name "*.astro" -o -name "*.html" \) 2>/dev/null | grep -iE "landing|sales|pricing|cta|hero|about" | head -10 || echo "no landing/sales pages"`
- Locale files: !`find . -path "*/locales/*" -o -path "*/i18n/*" 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "no i18n"`

## Pipeline position

```
/shipflow-keyword-research --> /shipflow-product-discovery[-digital] --> /shipflow-content-gen (articles)
                                                                     └─> /shipflow-copywriter (conversion copy)
                                                                          (you are here)
```

**This skill is NOT for articles.** Use `/shipflow-content-gen` for blog posts, roundups, reviews, how-tos. This skill writes **conversion copy** — text whose sole purpose is to get someone to take action (click, sign up, buy, subscribe).

## Mode detection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for copy type and subject:

- **`headline [product/topic]`** --> HEADLINE MODE: 20+ headline variants using proven formulas
- **`landing [product/topic]`** --> LANDING PAGE MODE: full above-the-fold + below-the-fold copy
- **`email [product/topic]`** --> EMAIL SEQUENCE MODE: 3-7 email nurture/sales sequence
- **`cta [product/topic]`** --> CTA MODE: button text, microcopy, urgency variants
- **`value-prop [product/topic]`** --> VALUE PROP MODE: positioning statement + supporting pillars
- **`full-funnel [product/topic]`** --> FULL FUNNEL MODE: all of the above as a complete conversion system

Add `--fr` or `--lang:fr` anywhere in arguments to generate in French.

## Copywriting Frameworks (use the right one for the context)

### AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
**Best for:** Landing pages, sales pages, product descriptions
```
Attention: Hook that stops the scroll
Interest: "Here's what makes this different..."
Desire: Paint the after-state, social proof, benefits
Action: Clear CTA with urgency
```

### PAS — Problem, Agitation, Solution
**Best for:** Email subject lines, ad copy, pain-point-driven products
```
Problem: Name the pain they feel
Agitate: Make the pain vivid — consequences of not solving it
Solution: Your product as the relief
```

### BAB — Before, After, Bridge
**Best for:** Case studies, testimonial-driven copy, SaaS landing pages
```
Before: Their current painful reality
After: Their life with the problem solved
Bridge: Your product is how they get there
```

### 4Ps — Promise, Picture, Proof, Push
**Best for:** Sales letters, high-ticket product pages
```
Promise: Bold claim about the outcome
Picture: Help them visualize the result
Proof: Testimonials, data, case studies
Push: Urgency + CTA
```

### StoryBrand — The Hero's Journey for Marketing
**Best for:** Brand messaging, about pages, mission statements
```
Character: The customer (not you) has a problem
Guide: You are the guide with empathy + authority
Plan: Give them a simple plan (3 steps)
CTA: Call them to action
Success: Show what success looks like
Failure: Show what failure looks like (stakes)
```

### Formule PAPA (French) — Problème, Agitation, Preuve, Action
**Best for:** French-market copy, same as PAS but with proof added
```
Problème: Nommer la douleur
Agitation: Amplifier les conséquences
Preuve: Témoignages, chiffres, résultats
Action: CTA clair avec urgence
```

## HEADLINE MODE

Generate 20+ headline variants organized by framework.

### Step 1: Research the product/topic

Use Exa/WebSearch to:
- Find existing headlines for competing products
- Identify the #1 pain point and #1 desired outcome
- Find specific numbers/results for credibility

### Step 2: Generate headline variants

#### Power Headlines (proven formulas)

**Number + Outcome:**
- "7 [Things] That [Desirable Outcome] (Without [Pain Point])"
- "[X] [People] Have Already [Achieved Outcome]. Here's How."

**How-To:**
- "How to [Achieve Outcome] in [Timeframe] (Even If [Objection])"
- "Comment [Résultat] en [Délai] (Même Si [Objection])" (FR)

**Question:**
- "Still [Doing Painful Thing]? There's a Better Way."
- "What If You Could [Desired Outcome] Without [Pain]?"

**Social Proof:**
- "Why [X,000] [Audience] Switched to [Product]"
- "The [Tool/Method] [Authority Figure] Uses to [Outcome]"

**Curiosity Gap:**
- "The [Adjective] [Thing] Most [Audience] Don't Know About [Topic]"
- "I [Did Thing] for [Time Period]. Here's What Happened."

**Urgency:**
- "[Outcome] Before [Deadline/Event]. Here's Your Plan."
- "Stop [Pain] Today. Start [Benefit] Tonight."

**Contrarian:**
- "Why [Common Advice] Is Actually Killing Your [Metric]"
- "[Controversial Opinion]: The Real Reason [Problem Exists]"

**French-Specific:**
- "Arrêtez de [Douleur]. Commencez à [Bénéfice]."
- "La Méthode [X] Pour [Résultat] (Prouvée par [Nombre] Utilisateurs)"
- "Pourquoi [X] [Audience] Ont Choisi [Produit] en [Année]"

### Step 3: Deliver with scoring

```

[1-2 sentences expanding the headline — addresses "how" or "for whom"]

### CTA Button
[Action verb + outcome] — e.g., "Start Your Free Trial" not "Submit"

### Supporting proof
[One-line social proof — "Trusted by 10,000+ teams" or "4.8/5 on G2"]

---

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### Section headline
["Get Started in 3 Steps" or "How It Works"]

1. **[Step 1]** — [What the user does + what happens]
2. **[Step 2]** — [What the user does + what happens]
3. **[Step 3]** — [What the user does + what happens (the outcome)]

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING (FAQ)

### [Objection as question]
[Answer that dissolves the objection]

### [Objection as question]
[Answer]

### [Objection as question]
[Answer]

---

## FINAL CTA SECTION

### Headline
[Restate the transformation — "Ready to [outcome]?"]

### Subheadline
[Risk reversal — "Start free. No credit card. Cancel anytime."]

[Same as hero CTA for consistency]

### Microcopy below button
["Join 10,000+ [audience] who already [outcome]"]
```

### Step 3: Deliver

---

## EMAIL SEQUENCE MODE

---

## VALUE PROP MODE

Create the core positioning statement and supporting pillars.

### Value Proposition Canvas

```
TARGET CUSTOMER: [Specific segment]
PAIN POINT: [#1 problem they face]
CURRENT ALTERNATIVES: [What they use now / do without]

VALUE PROPOSITION:
"[Product] helps [audience] [achieve outcome] by [mechanism],
unlike [alternative] which [limitation]."

FRENCH:
"[Produit] aide [audience] à [résultat] grâce à [mécanisme],
contrairement à [alternative] qui [limite]."

SUPPORTING PILLARS:
1. [Pillar 1 — key differentiator] — proof: [data/testimonial]
2. [Pillar 2 — key differentiator] — proof: [data/testimonial]
3. [Pillar 3 — key differentiator] — proof: [data/testimonial]

ELEVATOR PITCH (10 seconds):
"[One sentence that makes someone say 'tell me more']"

POSITIONING STATEMENT (internal):
"For [target], [product] is the [category] that [key benefit],
because [reason to believe]."
```

---

## FULL FUNNEL MODE

When `$ARGUMENTS` starts with "full-funnel", generate the complete conversion system:

1. **Value Proposition** (value-prop mode)
2. **Landing Page** (landing mode)
3. **Headlines** for ads/social (headline mode — top 5 only)
4. **Email Sequence** (email mode — 5-email welcome sequence)
5. **CTA Set** (cta mode — 5 variants)

All pieces should be tonally consistent and reference each other (landing page CTA matches email CTA, etc.).

---

## Language Handling

### French Copy Rules

French copywriting has specific conventions:

- **Typographic spaces** -- Use non-breaking space before `:`, `;`, `!`, `?`
- **Vouvoiement vs tutoiement** -- Default to "vous" (formal) unless the brand is casual/young (then "tu")
- **French punctuation** -- Guillemets « » not " " for quotes
- **Avoid anglicisms** -- "Télécharger" not "Downloader", "Courriel" not "Email" (though "email" is widely accepted)
- **French urgency words** -- "Offre limitée", "Plus que X places", "Dernière chance", "Ne manquez pas"
- **French trust signals** -- "Satisfait ou remboursé", "Sans engagement", "Garanti X jours"
- **Cultural tone** -- French audiences respond better to sophistication and logic than aggressive American-style hype. Less exclamation marks, more elegant persuasion.

When generating French copy, apply these rules automatically. When generating bilingual, output EN first, then FR variant with a `🇫🇷` header.

---

## Quality Checklist (all modes)

Before delivering any copy:

- [ ] **One CTA per section** -- Never give two competing actions
- [ ] **Benefits over features** -- "Save 3 hours/week" > "Automated scheduling"
- [ ] **Specific over vague** -- "10,847 users" > "thousands of users"
- [ ] **Active voice** -- "Start your trial" > "Your trial can be started"
- [ ] **Second person** -- "You" (or "Vous"/"Tu") not "Users" or "Customers"
- [ ] **No jargon** -- Write for the buyer, not the builder
- [ ] **Power words present** -- Free, New, Proven, Guaranteed, Instant, Secret, You
- [ ] **Objection handled** -- At least one objection addressed per section
- [ ] **Social proof present** -- Numbers, names, logos, testimonials
- [ ] **Urgency is real** -- Never fabricate false scarcity
- [ ] **Mobile-scannable** -- Short paragraphs, bold keywords, bullet points
- [ ] **No AI tells** -- No "leverage", "streamline", "cutting-edge", "in today's landscape"

---

## Important

- **Copy is not content.** Content informs. Copy persuades. Every word in copy must earn its place by moving the reader toward action. If a sentence doesn't advance the sale, cut it.
- **Research before writing.** Never write copy without understanding the audience's pain, current alternatives, and objections. Use Exa/WebSearch to find real customer language (reviews, forum posts, support tickets).
- **One reader, one action.** Write as if talking to one specific person. Ask for one specific action. Multiple CTAs kill conversion.
- **French copy is not translated English.** French copy must be written natively, not translated. The rhythm, cultural references, and persuasion patterns are different. "Découvrez comment..." is better than a literal translation of "Find out how...".
- **A/B testing is mandatory.** Always provide at least 2 variants for headlines and CTAs. The best copywriter in the world doesn't know what converts until it's tested.
- **Steal from reviews.** The best copy comes from customer language. Search product reviews for the exact words people use to describe their pain and desired outcome. Use those words.

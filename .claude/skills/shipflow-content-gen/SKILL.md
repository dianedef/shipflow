## Pre-Writing Phase (ALL article types)

### Step 1: Load existing research

Check for keyword and product data:
- Read `seo/keywords-[topic-slug].json` if it exists
- Read `seo/products-[topic-slug].json` if it exists
- If neither exists, offer to run `/shipflow-keyword-research` and/or `/shipflow-product-discovery` first

### Step 2: SERP research (use Exa + WebSearch)

Even with existing keyword data, always research the SERP before writing:

1. **Search the primary keyword** -- analyze what's ranking
2. **Fetch top 2-3 results** (WebFetch) -- analyze:
   - Heading structure (H1/H2/H3)
   - Content length
   - Unique sections/angles
   - Questions answered
   - Internal/external links
3. **Identify content gaps** -- what are competitors NOT covering?
4. **Find data points** -- statistics, expert quotes, studies to cite

### Step 3: Build the content brief

```
CONTENT BRIEF: [Article Title]
─────────────────────────────────
Primary keyword:     [from research]
Supporting keywords: [3-5 from research]
Search intent:       [I/CI/T]
Target word count:   [range]
Content type:        [Roundup/Review/Comparison/Informational/How-to]
Target audience:     [specific segment]
Unique angle:        [what makes this different from competitors]
Key sections:        [H2 outline]
Data points needed:  [stats, quotes, studies to include]
Products to feature: [if applicable, from product research]
CTA:                 [what action should the reader take?]
```

Present the brief to the user before writing. Ask for approval or adjustments.

## Post-Writing Phase (ALL article types)

### Step 1: SEO optimization check

Verify before delivering:

- [ ] Primary keyword in: H1, first 100 words, at least 2 H2s, meta description
- [ ] Supporting keywords appear naturally (not stuffed)
- [ ] All H2/H3 headings are descriptive (not generic like "Conclusion")
- [ ] Internal link opportunities noted (link to related content on the site)
- [ ] External links to authoritative sources (stats, studies, official docs)
- [ ] Images noted with ALT text suggestions containing keywords
- [ ] Meta title: under 60 chars, keyword-first, compelling
- [ ] Meta description: under 160 chars, includes keyword + CTA
- [ ] URL slug suggestion: short, keyword-rich, no stop words

### Step 2: Generate structured data (JSON-LD)

Generate appropriate Schema.org markup based on article type:

| Article Type | Schema Types |
|-------------|-------------|
| Product Roundup | `Article` + `ItemList` + `Product` per item + `FAQPage` |
| Product Review | `Article` + `Review` + `Product` + `FAQPage` |
| Comparison | `Article` + `Product` (x2) + `FAQPage` |
| Informational | `Article` + `FAQPage` |
| How-to | `Article` + `HowTo` + `FAQPage` |

Output the JSON-LD as a code block the user can paste into their page.

### Step 3: Content quality checklist

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Word count within target range (1200-2500 depending on type)
- [ ] No fluff paragraphs (every paragraph adds value)
- [ ] Tone matches site's existing content (if reference available)
- [ ] Claims are backed by data, sources, or reasoning
- [ ] Affiliate disclosures included where required (FTC compliance)
- [ ] No AI-sounding phrases ("in today's fast-paced world", "it's important to note", "delve into")
- [ ] Transitions between sections are natural
- [ ] CTA is clear and matches search intent
- [ ] Pros/cons are balanced and honest (not all positive)

### Step 4: Deliver the article

Output the full article in markdown, followed by:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ARTICLE METADATA
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Title:            [title]
Meta Title:       [SEO title, <60 chars]
Meta Description: [<160 chars, keyword + CTA]
URL Slug:         [suggested-slug]
Primary Keyword:  [keyword]
Supporting KWs:   [list]
Word Count:       [count]
Article Type:     [type]
Schema Markup:    [included below]
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[JSON-LD structured data block]

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OPTIMIZATION NOTES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
For higher SEO scores, consider:
  - Surfer SEO API: Score this article against SERP competitors
  - Frase API: Get content brief + optimization suggestions
  - DataForSEO MCP: Keyword density analysis
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 5: Save & offer next steps

Save article to appropriate location:
- If site uses Astro/Next/Nuxt: suggest proper content directory
- If no framework detected: save to `content/[slug].md`

Ask:

> **Article generated. What next?**
> 1. Edit/refine the article (tell me what to change)
> 2. Generate another article type for the same topic
> 3. Publish to WordPress (`wp-json/wp/v2/posts` endpoint)
> 4. Run SEO optimization score (requires Surfer/Frase API)
> 5. Generate more keyword research (`/shipflow-keyword-research`)

---

## Important (all types)

- **Research BEFORE writing.** Never generate content without SERP analysis first. The research phase is what separates mediocre content from ranking content.
- **Honesty over hype.** Affiliate content that's genuinely helpful converts better than salesy content. Always include real cons, not just pros.
- **FTC compliance.** Every article with affiliate links MUST include a disclosure: "This article contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission at no extra cost to you."
- **No AI slop.** Avoid: "In today's world", "It's worth noting", "Let's delve into", "Whether you're a beginner or expert", "In conclusion". Write like a knowledgeable human.
- **Data beats opinions.** Every claim should be backed by a data point, user review, expert quote, or logical reasoning. "This keyboard is good" loses to "This keyboard scored 4.8/5 across 12,000 reviews on Amazon."
- **Structured data is not optional.** Every article gets JSON-LD. This is how you win rich snippets.
- **Match the intent.** A "how to" searcher wants steps, not a product pitch. A "best X" searcher wants a curated list, not a 2000-word essay. Respect the intent.
- **The user's voice matters.** If existing content exists on the site, match its tone, reading level, and style. Don't impose a generic "content mill" voice.
- **Word count is a range, not a target.** 1200 words of substance beats 2500 words of padding. Hit the minimum, but don't pad.

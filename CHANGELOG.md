# ShipFlow Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Professional bug management doctrine with compact `TEST_LOG.md`, compact `BUGS.md`, per-bug `bugs/BUG-ID.md` dossiers, and redacted `test-evidence/BUG-ID/` evidence directories
- `templates/artifacts/bug_record.md` for structured bug dossiers with lifecycle status, reproduction, evidence, diagnosis notes, fix attempts, retest history, related artifacts, redaction status, and closure criteria
- `artifact: bug_record` support in `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`, including bug status, severity, redaction status, reproducibility, and `BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` ID validation
- Dependency-free ShipFlow metadata linter for specs and project decision-contract documents
- Skill-aligned artifact templates for specs, business context, brand context, audits, verification, readiness, review, research, and decision records
- Spec-first chantier registry doctrine: specs now carry `source_model`, `Skill Run History`, and `Current Chantier Flow` so skill runs can be reviewed from the spec without reading chat history
- Shared chantier tracking rules and an all-skills matrix covering mandatory, conditional, and non-applicable spec tracing behavior
- Internal skill taxonomy for chantier intake, including `source-de-chantier` process roles and standard `Chantier potentiel` routing to `/sf-spec`
- `sf-resume` — fast current-thread recap skill with task status bullets, close/keep-open verdict, and one critical reminder
- `sf-auth-debug` — browser-auth diagnostic skill for Clerk, OAuth, Google login, YouTube OAuth, Convex auth propagation, sessions, callbacks, protected routes, and Playwright-based reproduction
- Cross-project auth reference docs for the ContentFlow Flutter web ClerkJS bridge and the TubeFlow Next.js + Convex YouTube OAuth flow
- Public site tutorial page explaining how ShipFlow skill arguments can act as mode switches, structured inputs, or free-form tasks
- Dedicated public FAQ page for common ShipFlow questions around skills, docs scope, and workflow behavior

### Changed
- `sf-test`, `sf-fix`, `sf-verify`, `sf-ship`, `sf-docs`, and `sf-help` now share the same bug lifecycle, retest, evidence-redaction, and bug-gate rules
- README, workflow docs, `sf-test` README, and public skill pages now describe the compact index plus detailed bug dossier model instead of treating `BUGS.md` as the full bug record
- Existing Codex TUI spec migrated to the ShipFlow metadata frontmatter schema
- `sf-spec`, `sf-ready`, `sf-start`, `sf-verify`, `sf-end`, and `sf-ship` now report chantier status and trace lifecycle results when a unique spec-first chantier is identified
- Workflow documentation now links metadata doctrine to executable templates and linting
- `sf-fix`, `sf-start`, `sf-verify`, and `sf-prod` now route auth/browser-flow uncertainty through `sf-auth-debug` when browser evidence is needed
- Internal and public skill documentation now explain when to use `sf-auth-debug` and which auth references it carries
- Internal linking across the public site now routes homepage, docs, about, and "Why not just prompts?" traffic toward the new skill-modes tutorial and FAQ surfaces
- ShipFlow installer now targets selected eligible user accounts for AI configuration instead of mutating every `/home/*` account by default
- ShipFlow installer now owns Claude/Codex autonomous defaults, AI aliases (`c`, `co`, `cask`, `coask`), and per-user npm bootstrap for selected users
- Dotfiles installer now delegates Claude/Codex install and client MCP mutation to ShipFlow, and keeps only shared MCP registry linking

### Security
- Added root autonomous-mode guard in ShipFlow installer: autonomous Claude/Codex permissions on root now require explicit opt-in (`SHIPFLOW_AI_ALLOW_ROOT_AUTONOMOUS=1`)
- Added eligibility filtering before user AI mutation (non-root, real login shell, writable resolved home) to reduce accidental config writes on service/system accounts

### Removed
- Removed dotfiles-side Claude/Codex ownership actions (CLI install path, Codex config symlink ownership, and direct Claude/Codex client MCP mutation)

## [2026-04-25] - Contract metadata versioning across skills

### Added
- `sf-ready` — new readiness gate for specs before implementation, with explicit user-story alignment, adversarial review, workflow bypass checks, documentation coherence, and proportional cybersecurity review
- Standard artifact versioning rules for ShipFlow documentation: `metadata_schema_version` for the metadata contract and `artifact_version` for the document's decision content
- Versioned dependency tracking through `depends_on`, `required_status`, `next_review`, and `supersedes` so specs can declare which business and technical contracts they were built against
- Active documentation-coherence checks across implementation, verification, audit, docs, business-content, and shipping skills

### Changed
- `sf-spec`, `sf-ready`, `sf-start`, `sf-verify`, `sf-end`, `sf-docs`, and business/documentation-generating skills now treat business docs as versioned decision contracts, not passive context
- Audit skills now apply stronger product-coherence, user-story, documentation-drift, and security-risk scrutiny instead of limiting review to their narrow domain
- `sf-verify` now checks whether work was implemented against current docs, outdated docs, unknown dependency versions, or non-applicable contracts
- `sf-ship` now reports evidence limits explicitly and avoids claiming product, user-story, documentation, or security completion from commit/push alone

## [2026-04-25] - ShipFlow artifact and business-documentation doctrine

### Added
- `README.md` now frames ShipFlow as a professional work framework built around decision contracts, not just a collection of skills
- `shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md` now documents the artifact doctrine, standard metadata frontmatter, business docs as decision contracts, documentation coherence, and adoption/migration rules
- Business documentation (`BUSINESS.md`, `BRANDING.md`, personas, pricing, positioning, GTM docs) is now documented as technical decision infrastructure because it drives implementation, audits, shipping, and public claims

### Changed
- ShipFlow internal artifacts are now expected to use standardized metadata for status, confidence, risk, security impact, documentation impact, evidence, linked systems, and next step
- Documentation coherence is now described as part of feature completeness when product behavior, setup, permissions, API usage, pricing, onboarding, or support expectations change

## [2026-04-25] - Codex TUI defaults during install

### Changed
- `install.sh` now configures Codex TUI defaults for each user (`root` + `/home/*`) by writing a ShipFlow-managed block in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Added idempotent TOML upsert behavior for `tui.status_line` and `tui.terminal_title` while preserving user configuration outside the managed block

### Documentation
- `README.md` now documents the Codex defaults (`context-used` in status line and `thread` in terminal title), interactive fallback commands (`/statusline`, `/title`), and the current Codex customization boundary

## [2026-04-24] - Model routing and multi-agent execution topology

### Added
- `sf-model` — new skill to choose between `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, and `gpt-5.2` based on task profile, cost, latency, and execution risk
- `skills/sf-model/references/model-routing.md` — shared routing matrix so model-selection guidance can be reused consistently across ShipFlow skills

### Changed
- `sf-start` now chooses an execution topology (`single-agent` vs `multi-agent`) before implementation, with explicit file ownership, group boundaries, and integration responsibility
- `sf-start` now reads the shared `sf-model` routing reference, selects a primary execution model and reasoning effort, and can assign per-group model overrides for multi-agent runs

## [2026-04-23] - One-pass workflow docs and fresh-context policy

### Changed
- `README.md` now states the one-pass execution model explicitly: complete context before coding, no hidden dependency on chat history, and fresh-context escalation when needed
- `shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md` now documents that `sf-ready` and `sf-start` are the main points where a fresh context may be enforced for non-trivial execution
- The workflow docs now treat prompt-and-correct as a bounded fallback, not the default operating mode
- `CHANGELOG.md` records the fresh-context policy so the workflow shift is visible outside the skills themselves

## [2026-04-22] - Spec-driven workflow v3 and documentation cleanup

### Added
- `shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md` — living documentation for the ShipFlow V3 spec-driven workflow, including `sf-explore`, `sf-spec`, `sf-ready`, `sf-start`, `sf-verify`, and `sf-end`
- `archive/reports/README.md` and `archive/notes/README.md` — archive indexes for historical reports and obsolete notes

### Changed
- `sf-spec`, `sf-start`, `sf-ready`, and `sf-verify` aligned around a stricter spec-driven execution model with `sf-verify` now able to classify, reroute, and remediate bounded gaps
- Root documentation trimmed to living docs only; historical reports and obsolete notes moved out of the repository root into `archive/`
- `README.md` rewritten to reflect the current ShipFlow architecture, core docs, and the V3 workflow
- `archive/README.md` updated to distinguish living documentation from historical artifacts

## [2026-04-20] - Code audit: anti-duplication & convention drift

### Changed
- `sf-audit-code`: new checks for duplication/context-miss and convention drift (System Fit & Reuse in file audits; Consistency & Reuse in project audits)

- `sf-audit-copy`: new categories 8-11 — AI-Voice Detection (EN+FR blacklists, structural tells), AI-era Trust Signals, LLM-Answer-Engine Readiness (Princeton GEO), Conversion Copy 2025-2026; Framework Reference section (StoryBrand > PAS > JTBD > 4Cs > AIDA > Kennedy)
- `sf-enrich`: new Phase 4.5 — AI Visibility Layer with semantic chunking, Quick Answer, E-E-A-T concrete checklist, Schema.org matrix per page type; content decay scan in research phase

### Changed
- `sf-audit-seo`: FID removed, INP < 200ms becomes the responsiveness metric; images upgraded from "WebP/AVIF" to explicit AVIF-first via `<picture>`; keyword density downgraded to semantic completeness + entity coverage
- `sf-audit-design`: WCAG 2.2 target size rule refined with 8px spacing / 24px offset exemption; dark mode guidance updated to `light-dark()` + `color-scheme`
- `sf-audit-copy`: sentence length adds variance check (robotic uniformity is AI tell); CTA rule tightened to "action verb + specific outcome + timeframe"; French typography rules made explicit
- `sf-enrich`: internal linking expanded to topic cluster structure (pillar + 2-5 spokes); primary source preference added

## [2026-04-14] - No local builds in ship/verify flows

### Changed
- `sf-ship`: Step 6 pre-checks now run typecheck + lint only — `npm run build` removed (build runs in CI/Vercel at push)
- `sf-verify`: Step 7 technical checks replaces Build with Typecheck; explicit note to use `/sf-check` if a local build is really needed
- Both skills now document why local builds are forbidden, so future edits don't reintroduce them

## [2026-01-24] - Security & Robustness Improvements

### ✅ Priority 1 Tasks Completed

#### 🛡️ Input Validation (Issue #3)
Added comprehensive input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities:

**New Functions in `lib.sh`:**
- `validate_project_path()` - Validates file paths before use
  - Blocks path traversal attacks (`..` sequences)
  - Restricts to safe directories (`/root`, `/home`, `/opt`)
  - Prevents injection attacks (blocks `;`, `&`, `|`, `$`, backticks)
  - Ensures paths are absolute and exist

- `validate_env_name()` - Validates environment names
  - Allows only alphanumeric, dash, underscore, dot
  - Prevents names starting with dash or dot

- `validate_repo_name()` - Validates GitHub repository names
  - Ensures proper GitHub naming conventions
  - Prevents injection attacks

**Updated Functions:**
- `env_start()` - Now validates identifiers before processing
- `env_stop()` - Now validates identifiers before processing
- `env_remove()` - Now validates identifiers before processing

**Menu Integration:**
- `menu.sh` - Added validation to custom path input (line 357)
- `menu_simple_color.sh` - Added validation to custom path input (line 411)
- Both menus now validate GitHub repo names before deployment

#### 🔧 Prerequisite Checks (Issue #4)
Added automatic prerequisite validation to fail fast with helpful errors:

**New Function in `lib.sh`:**
- `check_prerequisites()` - Validates required tools are installed
  - **Critical tools:** `pm2`, `node` (must be installed)
  - **Optional tools:** `flox`, `git`, `python3` (warnings only)
  - Provides installation instructions on failure

**Updated Functions:**
- `init_flox_env()` - Now checks for `flox` before attempting to use it

**Menu Integration:**
- `menu.sh` - Runs prerequisite check on startup (line 18)
- `menu_simple_color.sh` - Runs prerequisite check on startup (line 48)

#### 🔒 SSH Tunnel Security
Added input validation to `local/dev-tunnel.sh`:
- Validates `REMOTE_HOST` format
- Validates `REMOTE_USER` format
- Prevents command injection via malformed hostnames/usernames

---

### 📊 Impact Summary

**Lines Changed:**
- `lib.sh`: +87 lines (new validation functions)
- `menu.sh`: +8 lines (validation calls)
- `menu_simple_color.sh`: +8 lines (validation calls)
- `local/dev-tunnel.sh`: +15 lines (validation)

**Security Improvements:**
